            <h1>Brewing Beer 101</h1>
            <p>Brewing your own beer can be cost effective and rewarding overtime if you choose the right technique. There is a variety of ways you can brew beef, but all of them follow a similar tactic. To make a basic brew, you will first need to start with the right equipment. You will need something to brew the beer in (such as a kettle), a fermenter, yeast, sanitizer, and a stir spoon. The equipment will need to be properly washed and sanitized first.</p>

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>Travis spends his days brewing beer. It all started when his brother and their friend got together one evening and a spontaneous purchase led to an enjoyable hobby. Several batches of beer later, the trio decided to incorporate in case they wanted to grow into something full time and that is how Wild Fox Brewing Company was born.</p>

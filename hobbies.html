            <h1>Brewing Beer with friends</h1>
            <p>One of the major things that occupies my time is brewing beer. My brother, our friend, and I started brewing beer as a way to kill time a few years ago. As it turns out, we ended up being fairly good at it. After spending time making beer, we decided to actually name it. We ended with naming our company Wild Fox Brewing Company. Thereâ€™s no real reason why we chose that name, other than foxes are fun to draw and we can come up with a few logos for our beers.</p>
            <p>Our plan is to have three constant beers with a fourth beer rotating throughout the year. Our three staples are a Mexican lager, a standard IPA, and a cream ale. Our seasonal beers rotate, as of now, between an Oktoberfest, a stout, a fruit-infused beer which depends on what is in season, and a cider. </p>
